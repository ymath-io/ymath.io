## FUNCTIONS

Draw a unit circle. Be sure to label the radius and axes.

1.  Label an angle Ө of your choice
2.  Label the lengths sin Ө and cos Ө

Draw two right triangles. Make them look like similar triangles. Label the sides with all possible sine and cosine values.

1.  Triangle MNQ: hypotenuse = 1 and one angle is Ө
2.  Triangle XYZ: hypotenuse = A and the "same" angle is Ө

Now, divide the length NQ by MN. Perform the same operation on the corresponding sides of triangle XYZ. Set each of these values as tan Ө. Does the value of tan Ө change with the size of the triangle?

How does your definition of tan Ө apply to the unit circle? Draw a new, better unit circle with this new value labeled.

Challenge: Instead of angle Ө, draw a 30, 60, or 45 degree angle and compute all lengths and remaining angles in the resulting right triangle.

Practice problems: Compute the following values using a unit circle.

1.  tan 45 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3.  cos 30 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
4.  sin 60 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
5.  cos 60 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6.  sin 45 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
7.  cos 45 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
