@statement
Show how the Pythagorean Theorem is a sub-case of the Law of Cosines. Type "done" in the answer box when you are done.

@hint
What terms do we need to remove to get the Pythagorean Theorem?

@solution
If we let $\angle C = 90$, then $\cos \angle C = 0$, meaning $-2ab \cos \angle C = 0$. Our equation then becomes: $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$
Which is the Pythagorean Theorem! We see that it is true when angle C is 90 degrees, or a right angle! This is of course not a
