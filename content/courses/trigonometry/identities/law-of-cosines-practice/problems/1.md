@statement
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to 0} x+1}$
1) Let $\displaystyle{AB = 1, BC = 1}$, and $\displaystyle{AC = \sqrt{3}}$ in $\triangle ABC$. Calculate $\angle ABC$

@hint
How can we use the Law of Cosines to solve this question?

@solution
We can plug in $x=0$ to the function, and see that
$$\lim_{x\to 0} x+1=0+1=1.$$
