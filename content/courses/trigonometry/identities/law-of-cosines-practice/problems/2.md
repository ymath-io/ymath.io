@statement
3) Let $AB = 10, BC = 13$, and $\angle ABC = 23˚$. The length of $AC$ can be written as $\sqrt{x - y \cos z}$, where $0˚ < z < 180˚$. Find $x + y + z$.

@hint
This is just an application of what we just learned!

@solution
Using the Law of Cosines, we quickly get:
$$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \angle ABC$$
