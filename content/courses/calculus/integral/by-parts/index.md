In differential calculus, we derived [formulas to differentiate products of functions](/learn/calculus/differential/methods).

Recall that $$\frac{d\ \color{teal}f(x) \color{forestgreen}g(x)}{dx} = \color{teal}f'(x)\color{forestgreen}g(x)+\color{teal}f(x)\color{forestgreen}g'(x)\color{white}.$$

**Integration by Parts** is a method to do the same sort of thing, for integrals.
