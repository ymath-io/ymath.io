In differential calculus, we derived [formulas to differentiate products of functions](/learn/calculus/differential/methods).

Recall that $$\frac{d\ \color{emerald}f(x) \color{green}g(x)}{dx} = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x).$$

**Integration by Parts** is a method to do the same sort of thing, for integrals.
