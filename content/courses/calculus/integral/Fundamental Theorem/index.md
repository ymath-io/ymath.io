title: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
---
In the previous lesson, we learned how to find the integral of the function $$y=2x$$. We were also introduced to a new concept - the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus considers the following situation,$$\frac{d f(x)+C}{dx} = F(x)$$where $C$ represents any constant (remember - the value of $C$ can be anything, because the derivative of a constant is 0.)

It states that we can perform the following algebra on the above:$$d f(x)+C =F(x) dx$$
$$∫(df(x)+C)=∫F(x)dx$$
$$f(x)+C=∫F(x)dx$$

This is because  _differentiation ($d$)_  and  _integration ($\int dx$)_  are inverse functions.

We can say that again -  **differentiation and integration are inverse functions.**

This is an incredibly useful piece of information - it allows us to compute the integral of so many functions! For example:

$$\frac{d \sin x}{dx}​=\cos x,$$

which tells us that
$$∫ \cos x  \ dx=\sin x.$$

Similarly, since
