title: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
---
In the previous lesson, we learned how to find the integral of the function $$y=2x$$. We were also introduced to a new concept - the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus considers the following situation,$$\frac{d f(x)+C}{dx} = F(x)$$where $$C$$ represents any constant (remember - the value of $$C$$ can be anything, because the derivative of a constant is 0.)

It states that we can perform the following algebra on the above:$$d f(x)+C =F(x) dx$$
