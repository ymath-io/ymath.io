Before you begin this chapter, it is integral that you are very comfortable with derivatives and you can easily replicate the [reference table](https://ymath.io/calculus/derivatives/rt) without any help.

Now, you must be thinking, what is an integral? Most people have heard that it is the area under a curve. That is a popular example of what we can do with integrals. A differentiation is the value of one ratio between the infinitesimally small differences in two function values. An integral is the value of the sum of the infinitesimal values that the function produces over a constant interval, multiplied by the length of the interval.

For example, let's try to take the integral of y=2x._y_=2_x_. We'll find the area under the line from 00 to some arbitrary point x,_x_, just as we found the slope at some point x_x_ during differentiation.
