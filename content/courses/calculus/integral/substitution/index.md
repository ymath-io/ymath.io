title: Integration by Substitution
---
Remember the  [Chain Rule](https://ymath.io/calculus/derivatives/chain-rule)? The Chain Rule said that we can perform the following algebra:
$$\frac{ d f(g(x))}{d g(x)} \cdot \frac{d g(x)}{dx} = \frac{ d f(g(x))}{dx}.$$

Now, how might we do the same sort of thing with integrals? In other words, can we find a similar formula for

$$\int f(g(x)) \ dx ?$$
