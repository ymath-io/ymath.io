In [Differential Calculus](/learn/calculus/differential), we learned that the derivative of a function describes its behavior at a specific point.

We can use this information to construct a line tangent to the function. These tangent lines are often a good approximation for values close to the tangent point as well.

But often, a line isn't a great representation of a function. Especially when the function isn't a line.

So, instead of a line, which is a first degree polynomial,  let's see if we can use a second-degree polynomial - a quadratic equation!

As an example, we'll try to find a "tangent" quadratic to the  function $f(x) = \sin(x).$

## Mimicking in the second degree
