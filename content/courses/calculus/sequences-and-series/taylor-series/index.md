In [Differential Calculus](/learn/calculus/differential), we learned that the derivative of a function describes its behavior at a specific point.

We can use this information to construct a line tangent to the function. These tangent lines are often a good approximation for values close to the tangent point as well.

But often, a line isn't a great representation of a function. Especially when the function isn't a line. The problem is, lines are always straight. They can tell us what direction a function is traveling in that moment, but it can't tell us where the function  had lunch today, its general mood, and where it plans to have dinner tonight.

We can't achieve this with a straight line. 

As an example, we'll try to find a "tangent" quadratic to the  function $f(x) = \sin(x).$
