In [Differential Calculus](/learn/calculus/differential), we learned that the derivative of a function describes its behavior at a specific point.

We can use this information to construct a line tangent to the function. These tangent lines are often a good approximation for values close to the tangent point as well.

But, what about a tangent curve?
