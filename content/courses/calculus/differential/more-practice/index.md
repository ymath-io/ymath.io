In the previous section, we learned useful formulae for solving
derivatives. They are called the

Product Rule:
$\displaystyle{\frac{df(x)g(x)}{dx} = f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)}$

and the

Quotient Rule:
$\displaystyle{\frac{d \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}{dx} = \frac{f'(x)g(x)-g'(x)f(x)}{(g(x))^2}}$

Now it\'s time to put these formulas to use.

Here are some practice problems to use these formulas.
