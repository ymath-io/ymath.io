Okay, so now you're a whiz at limits, but you still don't feel like you're doing Calculus!

Yeah, I know - you want to start writing $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and those weird S-shaped signs, that look like $\int$. I know I did!

In that case, my friend, we have some good news - we're not so far from all that. Just hang in there.

On with the lesson.


Suppose we have a function $y=3x-5$

What's the slope?

**It's 3, right?**

Good. Just checking.

Okay, next question. What's the slope of the line
$$y=x^2?$$

What do you mean, you don't know?

Oh... you mean it keeps changing? Right. When x increases at a constant speed, the speed at which y increases increases.

Go back, and read that to yourself a few more times, until it makes sense.
