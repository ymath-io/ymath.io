Okay, so now you're a whiz at limits, but you still don't feel like you're doing Calculus!

Yeah, I know - you want to start writing $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and those weird S-shaped signs, that look like $\int$. I know I did!

In that case, my friend, we have some good news - we're not so far from all that. Just hang in there.

On with the lesson.


Suppose we have a function $y=3x-5$

What's the slope?

**It's 3, right?**

Good. Just checking.

Okay, next question. What's the slope of the line
$$y=x^2?$$

What do you mean, you don't know?

Oh... you mean it keeps changing? Right. When x increases at a constant speed, the speed at which y increases increases.

Go back, and read that to yourself a few more times, until it makes sense.

In the graph above, the blue line is  _tangent_  to the parabola at the green point, which is called the  _point of tangency._

Try to move the green "tangent" point around and see the change in the slope of the line. Once you get a feel for what's going on, unhide the black line.

If we were to zoom in an infinite amount to the point of tangency, we'd have difficulty telling the line and parabola apart, because they get so close together.

In fact, you can try it yourself by clicking in the lower right of the graph and zooming in!

Because the line and the  _portion_  of the parabola are almost the same, we say that the slope of the parabola at the point of tangency is equal to the slope of the tangent.

Now, the only task we have is to develop a general equation for the slope of the parabola at any point.

**Note:** As you may have seen elsewhere, $Δ$ usually stands for "change in". In Calculus, $δ$ (lowercase $Δ$) usually means "a very small change in". That's $δ$ a definition you already know.

In the graph below, we have a zoomed-in version of $y=f(x)$ an arbitrary function. We've chosen two values of $x:$

$a$  and  a+δx.
