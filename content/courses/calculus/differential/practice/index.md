title: Practice with Derivatives
index: 7

---

In the previous lesson, we covered what a derivative is, and how to find
it.

We learned that the standard formula to find the derivative of a
function $f(x)$ is
$$\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x} = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}.$$

great $\LaTeX$ tutorials on the internet!

If you want to see how I typed something, you can right-click on any of
the math, and check out the TeX commands. Otherwise, Google is always
your friend.
