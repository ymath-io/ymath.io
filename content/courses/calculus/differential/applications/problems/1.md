@statement
The width of a rectangle increases at $4 \frac{cm}{s}$ and the height at
$3\ \frac{cm}{s}.$ What is the rate of change on the area with respect to $s$
when $h=5$ and $w=6$?

@hint
The information we have is:$$\frac{dh}{ds} = 3$$$$\frac{dw}{ds} = 4$$We
must find$$\frac{dwh}{ds} = ?$$

@hint
What are some of the methods of solving a derivative?

@solution
We can use the product rule to evaluate this
derivative:$$\frac{d wh}{ds} = h(\frac{dw}{ds})+ w(\frac{dh}{ds}).$$Substitute:$$\frac{d wh}{ds} = h(4)+ w(3).$$And,
when we plug in the given values:$$5\cdot  4 + 6\cdot 3 = \boxed{38}.$$
