Welcome to Differential Calculus!

Although they may seem intimidating, the words `differential` and `derivative` just mean "the slope".

For example, if we have a function 
$$ f(x) = 7x -4, $$


then we say the **derivative** of the function is the slope, which is $7$ in this case.

Another way to write this is 
$$ \frac{d f(x)}{dx} = 7. $$hi from differential calculus
