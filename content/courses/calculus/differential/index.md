Welcome to Differential Calculus!

In this lesson, you'll learn the words "derivative" and "differential". They are mostly the same - we will learn the difference in [Integral Calculus](/learn/calculus/integral).

Although they may seem intimidating, the words "differential" and "derivative" just mean "the slope".

For example, if we have a function 
$$ f(x) = 7x -4, $$


then we say the **derivative** of the function is the slope, which is $7$ in this case.

<!-- this is an html comment that won't show up-->

Another way to write this is 
$$ \frac{d f(x)}{dx} = 7. $$
