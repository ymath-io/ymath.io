In the previous lesson, we saw how derivatives can help us find the slope of a function. When the function's slope varies, the derivative gives us a formula for the slope, given the location.

In this lesson, we'll look at an interesting application of the above - constructing tangent lines to curvy functions.

Let's say we have a function $f(x)$, and we want to construct a line tangent to the function at the point $\left(a,f(a)\right).$

What should be the slope of the line? 

For the function to 'align' with the line at the desired point, they must have the same slope. So, the slope of the line must be equal to $f'(a)$, the slope of the function at $x=a$.

Using point-slope form, we have:
$$\text{point} = (a, f(a))$$ $$\text{slope} = f'(a)$$

$$y - f(a) = f'(a) (x-a).$$
