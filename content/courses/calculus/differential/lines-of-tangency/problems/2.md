@statement
If $f\left(x\right)=4-x^2,$ then the tangent lines at $x=-2$ and $x=2$ intersect at $\left(0,c\right).$ Find $c.$

@hint
How can we  break this problem into smaller parts? How many tangent lines do we need to find? 

@hint
Divide  the problem into smaller ones:
1. Find the tangent line at $x=-2$
2. Find the tangent line at $x=2$
3. Find their intersection point
