@statement
If $f\left(x\right)=4-x^2,$ then the tangent lines at $x=-2$ and $x=2$ intersect at $\left(0,c\right).$ Find $c.$

@hint
How can we  break this problem into smaller parts? How many tangent lines do we need to find? 

@hint
Divide  the problem into smaller ones:
1. Find the tangent line at $x=-2$
2. Find the tangent line at $x=2$
3. Find their intersection point

@solution

*For this problem, we will be needing the derivative of $f(x)$, so it is helpful to compute it ahead of time:* $$f'(x) = -2x.$$

1. Find the tangent line at $x=-2:$

$$\text{Point: } (-2,0)$$ $$\text{Slope: } f'(-2)=4$$ $$\text{Point-slope: } y-0=4(x+2)$$ $$y=4x+8.$$

2. Find  the tangent line at $x=2:$
	$$\text{Point: } (2,0)$$ $$\text{Slope: } f'(2)=4$$ $$\text{Point-slope: } y-0=-4(x-2)$$ $$y=8-4x.$$
	
3. Find the intersection point:
We know  that the $x$ value at the intersection point is $0$, so we just need to plug $x=0$ into one of  the equations.
$$y=4x+8=0+8=\boxed{8}.$$
