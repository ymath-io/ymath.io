@statement
Find the equation of the line tangent to $y = \cos x$ at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$. Express your answer in slope-intercept form.

@hint
What is the point of tangency?

@hint
What is the  slope at the point of tangency?

@solution
First, we identify the point of tangency. The question tells us to find the tangent line at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$
