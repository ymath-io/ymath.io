@statement
Find the equation of the line tangent to $y = \cos x$ at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$. Express your answer in slope-intercept form.

@hint
What is the point of tangency?

@hint
What is the  slope at the point of tangency?

@solution
First, we identify the point of tangency. The question tells us to find the tangent line at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}.$ 
So, our point is $$\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)\rightarrow\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right).$$

Now, we need the slope. The slope of $\cos x$ is modeled by its derivative, $\sin x$. 

So, $$\cos'\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -1.$$

Using point-slope, we get $$y-0=-1\cdot\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$$   
$$y=\frac{\pi}{2}-x.$$
