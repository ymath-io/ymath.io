The first-principles approach to finding a derivative is time consuming,
and often messy or difficult.  

As you continue to solve derivatives, you\'ll find yourself doing the
same manipulations over and over again for different problems.

Instead of wasting time like this, we can find efficient methods to
differentiate (find the derivative of) new functions using
differentiations that we already know.

For example, if we have a function $h(x) ={f(x)}{g(x)}$ and we want to
find $$\frac{d h(x)}{dx},$$ then we can find a formula for this in terms
of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, since $h(x)$ is defined using them.

@1 Try it on your own first, and plug it in when you think you&apos;ve got it.

That is what we call the **Product Rule**.

@2 Now division!
