title: Derivatives Reference Table
index: 13
type: lesson

---
In math, the general mantra should be to prioritize the \"how\" and the
\"why\" over the \"what\". This means, instead of memorizing facts, make
sure you understand exactly why they are true and how to arrive at them.

In Calculus, however, there are so many facts to remember that you
can\'t possibly store the proof of every single one in your brain if you
don\'t spend time revising them. This is a reference table of common and
basic derivative problems that you need to know by heart in order to
continue to the next lesson.

Do yourself a favor and don\'t memorize these. Don\'t make flashcards,
don\'t make a Quizlet, don\'t\... you get the idea. Instead, go to the
lessons where they were proved and read the proof again and again until
you think that you can do it without looking at the proof. Then, do
exactly that until you can. 

The purpose of this reference table is only to provide you with a list
of what is most important for you to know. Do not treat it like a
dictionary. 

$$\frac{d\sin x}{dx}=\cos x$$ $$\frac{d\cos x}{dx}=-\sin x$$
$$\frac{d\tan x}{dx}=\sec^2x$$ $$\frac{d\sec x}{dx}=\sec x\tan x$$
$$\frac{d\csc x}{dx}=-\csc x\cot x$$ $$\frac{d\cot x}{dx}=-\csc^2x$$
$$\frac{d\ln x}{dx}=\frac{1}{x}$$ $$\frac{de^x}{dx}=e^x$$
$$\frac{dx^n}{dx}=nx^{n-1}$$
