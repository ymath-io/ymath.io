@statement
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}}$

@hint
Always, when computing a limit, ask yourself: "Is there anything preventing me from just plugging in the value to the function?"

@hint
When you find what's preventing you from computing  $\frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}$  when  $x=2$, try to eliminate it.

@solution
We can't compute $\frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}$  when  $x=2$ because then we would be dividing by 0. However, remember that
