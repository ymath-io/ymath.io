@statement
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}}$

@hint
Always, when computing a limit, ask yourself: "Is there anything preventing me from just plugging in the value to the function?"

@hint
When you find what's preventing you from computing  $\frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}$  when  $x=2$, try to eliminate it.

@solution
We can't compute $\frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}$  when  $x=2$ because then we would be dividing by $0$. However, we see that
$$f(x)=\frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}= \frac{(x -2)(x+2)}{x-2}.$$
Remember that we are not finding $f(2)$, we are finding the _limit_ of f(x) as x _approaches_ 2. So, we can divide the top and bottom of the fraction by $(x−2)$ because we know $(x−2)$ is not equal to $0$, but rather very, very, close. Hence, our answer is $x+2=2+2=4.$
