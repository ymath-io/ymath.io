Title: Applications
---
Remember in the beginning, we said that when we get to derivatives, we'll be doing limits all the time? Now is the time to learn some useful limits that you are going to rely heavily on in the future. The first one of these is
$$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin{x}}{x}.$$
The solution to this limit is not immediately obvious, so we are going to take a detour and review something that you (should have) learned in Precalculus.
