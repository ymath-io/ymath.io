Title: Applications

Remember in the beginning, we said that when we get to derivatives, we'll be doing limits all the time? Now is the time to learn some useful limits that you are going to rely heavily on in the future. The first one of these is
$$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin{x}}{x}.$$
The solution to this limit is not immediately obvious, so we are going to take a detour and review something that you (should have) learned in Precalculus.

In the graph above, we have 3 values :
$$\sin{\theta}, \theta, \tan{\theta}.$$
If you don't immediately have an answer, think for a few minutes about how we could order these three values in an inequality. One possible (wrong) answer is
$$\tan{\theta} < \theta < \sin{\theta}.$$
Record your answer here before continuing:

Looking at the graph tells us that
$$\sin{\theta} < \theta < \tan{\theta}.$$
