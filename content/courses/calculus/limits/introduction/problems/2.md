@statement
Notice that the graphed function is linear. What linear function does it look like?

@hint
What's the slope? The y-intercept?

Remember,  $$y=mx+b.$$

@solution

We can find two points, $(0,1)$ and $(2,3)$ (remember, we can't use $(1,2)$!), and use these to find the slope.
$$m=\frac{3-1}{2-0} = \frac{2}{2} = 1.$$

Then, we can see the y-intercept is at  $(0,1)$. Our slope-intercept equation is $$y=x+1.$$
