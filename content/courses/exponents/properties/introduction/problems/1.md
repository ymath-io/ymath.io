@statement
Evaluate $2^3$.

@hint
Which number is the base? Which is the exponent?

@hint
Try rewriting the expression as repeated multiplication. 

@solution
The bottom-left number ($2$) is the base and the top-right number ($3$) is the exponent. In a power, the exponent tells you how many times to multiply the base by itself.
