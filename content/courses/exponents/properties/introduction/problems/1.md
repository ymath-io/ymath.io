@statement
Evaluate $2^3$.

@hint
Which number is the base? Which is the exponent?

@hint
Rewrite the expression as one number repeatedly multiplied by itself. 

@solution
$2$ (the bottom-left number) is the base and $3$ (the top-right number) is the exponent. In a power, the exponent tells you how many times to multiply the base by itself.
