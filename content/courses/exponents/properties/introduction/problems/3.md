  - "11^5"

@statement
Evaluate $-1^4$.

@hint
Is the negative sign part of the power?

@hint
Remember the Order of Operations

@solution
We see that $11$ is multiplied by itself $5$ times, so $11$ is the base, and $5$ is the exponent. In exponential form, we write this as $11^5$, and we type it as 11^5.
