@statement
Evaluate $-1^4$.

@hint
Is the negative sign part of the power?

@hint
Remember the Order of Operations -- multiplication comes after exponentiation.

@solution
The expression $-1^4$ is equivalent to $-1\cdot1^4$. By the Order of Operations, we find that 
$$-1\cdot1^4=-1\cdot(1\cdot1\cdot1\cdot1)
=-1\cdot1=-1$$
Note that $-1^4\neq(-1)^4=1$.
