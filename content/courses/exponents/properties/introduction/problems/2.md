  - "11^5"

---

@statement
Write $11\cdot11\cdot11\cdot11\cdot11$ in exponential form.

@hint
What's the base? What's the exponent?

@solution
We see that $11$ is multiplied by itself $5$ times, so $11$ is the base, and $5$ is the exponent. In exponential form, we write this as $11^5$, and we type it as 11^5.
