title: Same Exponent Properties

---

In the previous lesson, we learned that two powers with the same base can be combined together. But what if two powers have the same exponent? There are 

### List of Exponent Properties
- Product of Powers: $x^a\cdot x^b=x^{a+b}$
- Quotient of Powers: $\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}$
- Power to a Power: $(x^a)^b=x^{ab}$
- Power of a Product: $(xy)^a=x^a\cdot y^a$
- Power of a Quotient: $\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^a=\frac{x^a}{y^a}$
