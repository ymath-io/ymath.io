title: Same Exponent Properties

---

In the previous lesson, we learned that two powers with the same base can be combined together. But what if two powers have the same exponent? There are properties involving this scenario, too - the Power of a Product Property and the Power of a Quotient Property. 

- Power of a Product: $(xy)^a=x^a y^a$
- Power of a Quotient: $\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^a=\frac{x^a}{y^a}$

## Power of a Product
Let's try simplifying $(xy)^2$. We expand to get
$$(xy)^2=(xy)(xy)=x\cdot x\cdot y\cdot y=x^2y^2$$
Interesting. Does this work for any exponent?
$$(xy)^a=\underbrace{(xy)(xy)\c}=x\cdot x\cdot y\cdot y=x^2y^2$$

## Power of a Quotient
Coming soon!
