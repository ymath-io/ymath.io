type: problem
answers:
  - $\frac{p^tq^t}{r^ts^t}$

---

@statement
Expand and simplify $\left(\frac{pq}{rs}\right)^t$. 

@hint
Rewrite $\frac{pq}{rs}$ as the product of two fractions.

@hint
Use both the Power of a Product Rule and the Power of a Quotient Rule.

@solution
We write $\$
$$a(bcd)^e
= a(b(cd))^e
= a(b^e(cd)^e)
=a(b^e(c^ed^e))
=ab^ec^ed^e$$
Note that there are many different ways to solve the problem, and they all lead to the same solution.
