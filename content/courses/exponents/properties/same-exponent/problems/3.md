  - "ab^ec^ed^e"

@statement
Expand and simplify $\left(\frac{pq}{rs}\right)^t$. (Do not input any spaces or change the order of the variables.)

@hint
Rewrite $\frac{pq}{rs}$ as the product of two fractions.

@hint
Use both the Power of a Product Rule and the Power of a Quotient Rule.

@solution
We first apply the Power of a Product Rule on $b$ and $cd$, then on $c$ and $d$.
$$a(bcd)^e
= a(b(cd))^e
= a(b^e(cd)^e)
=a(b^e(c^ed^e))
=ab^ec^ed^e$$
