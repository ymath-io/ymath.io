@statement
Expand and simplify $a(bcd)^e$.

@hint
Plug in values into the Power of a Product rule. 

@hint
You could also try rewriting the expression as repeated multiplication. 

@solution
By the Power of a Product rule, $(pq)^3=p^3q^3$. We can also write this as repeated multiplication. 
$$(pq)^3=(pq)(pq)(pq)=(ppp)(qqq)=p^3q^3$$
