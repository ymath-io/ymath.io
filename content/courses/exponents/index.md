Exponents and logarithms are *power*-ful tools in mathematics. You must have a *base*-ic understanding of them if you want to learn topics like calculus.

Alright, enough puns. Before you begin this course, brush up on the following topics if you're not very familiar with them:

- Arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Some pre-algebra. You should be familiar with variables and fractions! 

This course covers the following topics:
- properties, graphs, and real-world applications of exponents and logarithms
- scientific notation

These topics encompass a wide range of difficulties. If the course is too easy, feel free to skip lessons. And if it's too difficult, try practicing some other math topics before coming back to this course.
