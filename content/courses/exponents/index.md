Exponents and logarithms are *power*-ful tools in mathematics. You must have a *base*-ic understanding of them if you want to learn topics like calculus.

Alright, enough puns. Before you begin this course, brush up on the following topics if you're not very familiar with them:

- Basic pre-algebra. You should already be familiar with variables and fractions! 

This course covers the following topics:
- properties, 

As you can see, this course encompasses a wide range of difficulties. If the course is too easy, feel free to skip lessons. And if it's too difficult, try learning some different math topics before coming back to this course.
