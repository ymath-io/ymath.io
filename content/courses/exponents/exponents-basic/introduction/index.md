Sometimes, we want to multiply a number by itself many times. Instead of having to write out $3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$, we can use something called *exponential form.*

$$3^5=3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$$
(read as 3 to the power of 5, 3 to the 5th power, or 3 to the 5th)

In the example above, $3^5$ means "multiply 3 by itself 5 times." The "5" is called the *exponent,* and the "3" is called the *base.* A base together with its exponent are called a *power*.

To type a power on a computer, type {base}^{exponent}. For example, for 3^5 we would type 3^5 or {3}^{5}. 

Let's look at a more complicated example. 
$$(x-1)^{2y}$$

### Warnings
$x^y$ is not the same thing as $y^x$. For example, $2^3=8$ and $3^2=9$. This is different from addition and multiplication, where you can switch the numbers around.
