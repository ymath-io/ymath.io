Sometimes, we want to multiply a number by itself many times. Instead of having to write out $3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$, we can use something called *exponential form.*

$$3^5=3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$$
(read as 3 to the power of 5, 3 to the 5th power, or 3 to the 5th)

In the example above, $3^5$ means "multiply 3 by itself 5 times." The "5" is called the *exponent,* and the "3" is called the *base.* A base together with its exponent are called a *power*.

To type a power on a computer, type {base}^{exponent}. For example, for 3^5 we would type 3^5 or {3}^{5}. 

Let's look at another example. 
$$(x-1)^{2y}$$
The base is $x-1$, and the exponent is $2y$. So, this expression means to multiply $x-1$ by itself $2y$ times.

Now for an interesting question: what is $3^0$? Well, we are multiplying 3 by itself 0 times, 

### Identity Element
An *identity element* is special because it doesn't change the value of another element when an operation is applied to both elements. For now, we can just think of elements as numbers. 

For example, the *additive identity* is 0 because adding 0 to any number doesn't change its value. 
$$5+0=5$$
Similarly, the *multiplicative identity* is 1 because multiplying any number by 1 doesn't change its value.  
$$5\cdot1=5$$

When we rewrite multiplication as repeated addition, we can write the additive identity at the beginning. For example, 
$$3\cdot2=0+3+3$$
Using this notation, it should be obvious that 
$$3\cdot1=0+3$$
$$3\cdot0=0$$

Likewise, we can rewrite exponentiation as repeated multiplication with the multiplicative identity in the beginning.
$$3^2=1\cdot3\cdot3$$
$$3^1=1\cdot3$$

### Warnings
- Usually, $x^y$ is not equal to $y^x$. For example, $2^3=8$ and $3^2=9$. This is different from addition and multiplication, where you can switch the numbers around. 
- Remember your order of operations when working with exponents. Exponents come before all operations except parentheses!
$$x\cdot y^z=x\cdot(y^z)​\neq (x\cdot y)^z$$
$$-y^z=-1\cdot(y^z)​\neq (-y)^z$$
