Sometimes, we want to multiply a number by itself many times. Instead of having to write out $3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$, we can use something called *exponential form.*

$$3^5=3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$$
(read as 3 to the power of 5, 3 to the 5th power, or 3 to the 5th)

In the example above, $3^5$ means "multiply 3 by itself 5 times." The "5" is called the *exponent,* and the "3" is called the *base.* A base together with its exponent are called a *power*.

To type a power on a computer, type {base}^{exponent}. For example, for 3^636 we would type 3^6.
