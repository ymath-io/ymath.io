Sometimes, we want to multiply a number by itself many times. Instead of having to write out $3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$, we can use something called *exponential form.*

$$3^5=3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3$$

In the example above, $3^5$ means "multiply 3 by itself 5 times." The "5" is called the *exponent,* and the "3" is called the *base.*
