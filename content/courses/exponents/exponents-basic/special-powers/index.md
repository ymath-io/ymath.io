You may have remembered from the introduction to this chapter that any number to the power of $0$ is $1$. In this lesson, we'll use our new exponent properties to find some other interesting patterns. 

## $1$ as a Base
As usual, let's start with a few examples so that we can look for patterns. 
$$1^1=1$$
$$1^2=1\cdot1$$
$$1^3=1\cdot1\cdot1$$
$$1^4=1\cdot1\cdot1\cdot1$$
$$1^5=1\cdot1\cdot1\cdot1\cdot1$$
