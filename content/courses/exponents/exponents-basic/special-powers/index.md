title: Special Powers

---

You may have remembered from the introduction to this chapter that any number to the power of $0$ is $1$. In this lesson, we'll find some other interesting patterns and use our exponent properties to prove some of them. 

### List of Special Powers
For any positive integer $x$,
$$x^1=x$$
$$x^0=1$$
$$1^x=1$$
$$0^x=0$$
$$\text{$10^x$ has $x$ zeroes}$$




## $1$ as an Exponent

## $0$ as an Exponent
Earlier in this course, we saw a way to show that $x^0=1$ using the multiplicative identity. 

### What about $0^0$?
This is a tricky question! By our $0$ as a Base Rule, it should equal $0$, but by our $0$ as an Exponent Rule, it should equal $1$. So, which is it? 

Most mathematicians think the answer is either $1$ or $\text{undefined}$. The answer of $1$ makes more sense in some branches of mathematics, while the answer of $\text{undefined}$ makes more sense in other branches. For this course, you can treat this expression the same way as you would treat the expression $\frac{0}{0}$ -- just avoid it!
