You may have remembered from the introduction to this chapter that any number to the power of $0$ is $1$. In this lesson, we'll find some other interesting patterns and use our exponent properties to prove some of them. 

### List of Special Powers
For any positive integer $x$,
$$x^1=x$$
$$x^0=1$$
$$1^x=1$$
$$0^x=0$$
$$\text{$10^x$ is a $1$ followed by $x$ zeroes}$$


## $1$ as an Exponent
Let's start with a few examples so that we can look for patterns. We will write the examples in the same format as $3^2=1\cdot3\cdot3=9$. This format will make it clearer that when we write out powers, we are multiplying numbers together, not adding them. 

$$1^1=1\cdot1=1$$
$$2^1=1\cdot2=2$$
$$3^1=1\cdot3=3$$
$$4^1=1\cdot4=4$$

Do you see the pattern? Any number multiplied by itself $1$ time is just itself! We can write this as
$$x^1=1\cdot x = x$$
where $x$ is any positive integer.

## $0$ as an Exponent
Earlier in this course, we saw a way to show that $x^0=1$ using the multiplicative identity. Just to review, 
$$x^3=1\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x$$
$$x^2=1\cdot x\cdot x$$
$$x^1=1\cdot x$$
$$x^0=1$$

Now, you might be thinking, why didn't we write it using the additive identity instead of the multiplicative identity?  
$$x^3=0+x\cdot x\cdot x$$
$$x^2=0+x\cdot x$$
$$x^1=0+x$$
$$x^0=0$$
Sure, exponentiation is repeated multiplication, so using the additive identity doesn't make much sense here, but just because there's a pattern doesn't mean something is true. So, let's use our exponent properties to show that $x^0=1$ makes a lot more sense than $x^0=0$. 

What is $\frac{x^n}{x^n}$? Well, as long as $x^n$ isn't $0$, it should equal $1$ because any number (except $0$) divided by itself equals $1$. The numerator and the denominator cancel out. 

By the Quotient of Powers Property, we can also write $\frac{x^n}{x^n}$ as $x^{n-n}$. So, 

$x^0=x^{n-n}=\frac{x^n}{x^n}=1$

Can you see why $x^0$ is defined as $1$ rather than $0$?


## $1$ as a Base
Let's start with a few examples so that we can look for patterns. 
$$1^1=1$$
$$1^2=1\cdot1=1$$
$$1^3=1\cdot1\cdot1=1$$
$$1^4=1\cdot1\cdot1\cdot1=1$$

Notice anything? There is a clear pattern: $1$ to the power of any number is still $1$. This makes sense because no matter how many times you multiply $1$ by itself, the product should always be $1$. 

If we call the exponent $x$, we get
$1^x=1$, where $x$ is any number. 

## $0$ as a Base

As before, let's look at some examples.
$$0^1=0$$
$$0^2=0\cdot 0=0$$
$$0^3=0\cdot 0\cdot 0=0$$
$$0^4=0\cdot 0\cdot 0\cdot 0=0$$

Since $0$ multiplied by itself any number of times is stil

### What about $0^0$?
This is a tricky question! By our $0$ as a Base Rule, it should equal $0$, but by our $0$ as an Exponent Rule, it should equal $1$. So, which is it? 

Let's try using our exponent properties. 
$$x$$

Most mathematicians think the answer is either $1$ or $\text{undefined}$. The answer of $1$ makes more sense in some branches of mathematics, while the answer of $\text{undefined}$ makes more sense in other branches. For this course, you can treat this expression the same way as you would treat the expression $\frac{0}{0}$ -- avoid it whenever possible.

## $10$ as a Base

As always, let's see some examples.

$$10^0=1$$
$$10^1=10$$
$$10^2=10\cdot 10=100$$
$$10^3=10\cdot 10\cdot 10=1000$$

Notice a pattern? Since multiplying a number by 10 adds a zero to the end, the product of $x$ $10$'s is a $1$ with $x$ zeroes at the end. Thus, 
$10^x$ is a $1$ followed by $x$ zeroes.
