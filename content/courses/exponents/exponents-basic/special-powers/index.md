You may have remembered from the introduction to this chapter that any number to the power of $0$ is $1$. In this lesson, we'll use our new exponent properties to find some other interesting patterns. 

## $1$ as a Base
Let's start with a few examples so that we can look for patterns. 
$$1^1=1$$
$$1^2=1\cdot1=1$$
$$1^3=1\cdot1\cdot1=1$$
$$1^4=1\cdot1\cdot1\cdot1=1$$

Notice anything? There is a clear pattern: $1$ to the power of any number is still $1$. This makes sense because no matter how many times you multiply $1$ by itself, the product should always be $1$. 

If we call the exponent $x$, we get
$1^x=1$, where $x$ is any number. 

## $0$ as a Base

As before, let's look at some examples.
$$0^1=0$$
$$0^2=0\cdot 0=0$$
$$0^3=0\cdot 0\cdot 0=0$$
$$0^4=0\cdot 0\cdot 0\cdot 0=0$$
