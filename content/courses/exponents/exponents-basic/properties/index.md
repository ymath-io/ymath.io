You should have remembered from the previous lesson that any number to the power of 0 is 1. In this lesson, we'll explore some other interesting properties of exponents!

### Product of Powers
Let's start with a simple question. What is 
$2^5$?

We know a way to evaluate exponents -- write them as multiplication! 

$$2^5=2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2=32$$

So, it equals 32. How about another question: what is $2^2\cdot2^3$?

We can solve this using the Order of Operations. We evaluate
$$2^2\cdot2^3=(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)=(4)(8)=32$$

Notice anything? It's the same answer as before! Is it a coincidence?

It turns out that a very important clue is in the first step of evaluating both expressions. Take a look:
$$2^5=2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2$$
$$2^2\cdot2^3=(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)$$
