You should have remembered from the previous lesson that any number to the power of 0 is 1. In this lesson, we'll explore some other interesting properties of exponents!

### Product of Powers
Let's start with a simple question. What is 
$2^5$?

We know a way to evaluate exponents -- write them as multiplication! 

$$2^5=2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2=32$$

So, it equals 32. How about another question: what is $2^2\cdot2^3$?

We can solve this using the Order of Operations. We evaluate
$$2^2\cdot2^3=(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)=(4)(8)=32$$

Notice anything? It's the same answer as before! Is it a coincidence?

It turns out that a very important clue is in the first step of evaluating both expressions. Take a look:
$$2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2$$
$$(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)$$

They look very similar! In fact, they're equal by the Associative Property of Multiplication. This property states that if your expression only has multiplication in it, it doesn't matter where you put the parentheses. The product will always be the same. 

Let's go a bit more general. Is there a way we can rewrite $x^2\cdot x^3$? Let's try:

$$x^2\cdot x^3
=(x\cdot x)(x\cdot x\cdot x)
=x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x
=x^5$$

Nice! We just showed that $x^2\cdot x^3 = x^5$. $x^2$ is the product of $2$ $x$'s, and $x^3$ is the product of $3$ $x$'s, so the product of $x^2$ and $x^
