You should have remembered from the previous lesson that any number to the power of 0 is 1. In this lesson, we'll explore some other interesting properties of exponents!

### Product of Powers
Let's start with a simple question. What is 
$2^2\cdot2^3$?

We can solve this using the Order of Operations. We evaluate
$$2^2\cdot2^3=(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)=(4)(8)=32$$

Yay, we did it! How about another question: what is $2^4\cdot2^1$? We can solve this using the same method:

$$2^4\cdot2^1=(2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2)(2)=(16)(2)=32$$

Okay, now you might be thinking, why is $2^2\cdot2^3$ equal to $2^4\cdot2^1$? Is it just a coincidence? 

A very important clue is in 

### Quotient of Powers

### Power to a Power

### Power of a Product

### Power of a Quotient

### $1$ as a Base

### $0$ as an Exponent
