You should have remembered from the previous lesson that any number to the power of 0 is 1. In this lesson, we'll explore some other interesting properties of exponents!

## Product of Powers
Let's start with a simple question. What is 
$2^5$?

We know a way to evaluate powers -- write them as multiplication! 

$$2^5=2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2=32$$

So, $2^5=32$. How about another question: what is $2^2\cdot2^3$?

We can solve this using the Order of Operations. We evaluate
$$2^2\cdot2^3=(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)=(4)(8)=32$$

Notice anything? It's the same answer as before! Is it a coincidence?

It turns out that a very important clue is in the first step of evaluating both expressions. Take a look:
$$2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2$$
$$(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)$$

These expressions look very similar! In fact, they're equal by the Associative Property of Multiplication. This property states that if your expression only has multiplication in it, it doesn't matter where you put the parentheses. The product will always be the same. 

Let's go a bit more general. Is there a way we can rewrite $x^2\cdot x^3$? Let's try:

$$x^2\cdot x^3
=(x\cdot x)(x\cdot x\cdot x)
=x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x\cdot x
=x^5$$

Nice! We just showed that $x^2\cdot x^3 = x^5$. In other words, $x^2$ is the product of $2$ $x$'s, and $x^3$ is the product of $3$ $x$'s, so the product of $x^2$ and $x^3$ is the product of $5$ $x$'s in total. 

Let's make an even more general statement! What is $x^a \cdot x^b$?

We can't write this out in multiplication because we don't know what $a$ and $b$ are, so we don't know how many $x$'s to write! But, we can use the power (pun unintended) of imagination:

$$x^a \cdot x^b = (\text{product of $a$ $x$'s})(\text{product of $b$ $x$'s})$$

That should give us a total of $(a+b)$ $x$'s multiplied together, which is the same as $x^{a+b}$. So, 

$$x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$$

Can you see why this property is called the Product of Powers Property?

### Warnings
The bases of the powers have to be the same for this property to work. If you try to simplify $x^2\cdot y^3$, you will not get anywhere since it's already simplified.
$$x^2 \cdot y^3=(x\cdot x)(y\cdot y\cdot y)$$
Clearly, this is a dead end, so the expression is simplified. Don't make up properties of exponents unless you know they're true because chances are, the property will be false!
