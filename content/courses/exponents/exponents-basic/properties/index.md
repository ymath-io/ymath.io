You should have remembered from the previous lesson that any number to the power of 0 is 1. In this lesson, we'll explore some other interesting properties of exponents!

### Product of Powers
Let's start with a simple question. What is 
$2^2\cdot2^3$?

One way we can solve this is to use the Order of Operations. We can evaluate
$$2^2\cdot2^3=(2\cdot2)(2\cdot2\cdot2)=(4)(8)=32$$

### Quotient of Powers

### Power to a Power

### Power of a Product

### Power of a Quotient

### $1$ as a Base

### $0$ as an Exponent
