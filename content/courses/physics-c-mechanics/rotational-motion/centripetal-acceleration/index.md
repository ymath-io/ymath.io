title: Centripetal Acceleration
type: lesson

---

If you've played tether ball, swung a yo-yo, or spun a necklace on your finger, you've witnessed **centripetal motion**. 

Centripetal motion is when an object travels around a fixed point, in a circle. 

Assuming out angular velocity ($\omega: \text{rad/s}$) is constant, we will construct equations for the object's position, velocity, and acceleration.

The angular displacement of the object can be represented using a vector:
$$ x = \left<  r\cos\omega t , r\sin\omega t\right>.$$
From the definition of velocity, we know that
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \overline{v}
