Often, we come across functions that we do not know how to evaluate without having qualitative knowledge of the input value. For example, $\sin(x)$, $\max(x, y)$[^1] , and $|x|$.


For example, how do we compute  $\min(x,y)$  without knowing beforehand what  $x$  and  $y$  are, using only a basic calculator[^2]?

This question, along with many others, will be answered in this short course.

[^1]: $\max$ stands for *maximum*. $\max(x,y)$ will always return the larger value out of $x$ and $y$. Similarly, $\min(x,y)$ (*minimum*) returns the smaller of $x$ and $y$.

[^2]: For the purpose of this course, we will assume our calculator to have the following capabilities:
	* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
	* Exponentiation
		* including square roots
