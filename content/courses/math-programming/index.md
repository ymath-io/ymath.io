Often, we come across functions that we do not know how to evaluate without having qualitative knowledge of the input value. For example, $\sin(x)$, $\max(x, y)$[^1] , and $|x|$.


For example, how do we compute  $\min(x,y)$  without knowing beforehand what  $x$  and  $y$  are, using only a four function calculator?

This question, along with many others, will be answered in this short course.
