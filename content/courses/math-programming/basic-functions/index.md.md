title: Basic Functions

---

In this chapter, we'll cover some of the basic building blocks for more complex functions that we will build in later chapters.

Some terminology and concepts used in this chapter are listed below.

## Types of Functions

### Valued Functions
A *valued function* is one that can return anything, and is highly dependent on the input.
 An example of a valued function is
 $$ f(x) = 4x+7.$$

### Boolean Functions
A *boolean function* is one that returns either `0` or `1`.  In computer science, *boolean* means a value that is `true` or `false`.

In our boolean functions, a value of `0` will mean that a certain condition is false, and a value of `1` will mean that the condition is true. These boolean functions are exceptionally useful while implementing conditions in our formulas.
