Often, as we saw in the last lesson, we need to make choices depending on whether a number is larger than another. For example, let's say we have two test grades, $x$ and $y$. Whoever got the higher test grade get five extra credit points for superb performance.

In Python, this would look something like
```py
def applyExtraCredit(x: float, y: float) 
```
