title: Absolute Value

---

Many times in ___, we just want the magnitude of our number. For example, if we're calculating the distance between two numbers, we will want the absolute value of their difference.

In Java, this would be
```java
static float distanceBetween(float x, float y){
	return Math.abs(x-y);
}
```
