Multivariable calculus is, as the name implies, [calculus](/learn/calculus) with multiple variables. Traditional calculus is often referred to as *single variable* calculus.

Why, you may ask, do we need to bother juggling multiple variables at once? Can we not simply take them two at a time? In fact, "taking it two at a time" is the basis of the analysis we'll learn in this course. Bon appetit?
