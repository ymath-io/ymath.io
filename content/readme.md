Welcome to the content writing guide for YMath! 

## Setting up a development environment

If you're reading this document right now, you're either on  StackEdit or Github. If you're on StackEdit, then skip this section, you're all good! If you're on Github, then sign in/ sign up before following these instructions.

1. Make sure you have an account at https://github.com. 
2. Make sure Saumya has added you to the Content Management team at YMath.io. 
3. Make sure there's a branch with your name in the website's Github Repository, and if not, make one. (Ask Saumya if you're not sure.)
4. Visit https://stackedit.io/ and click "start writing" at the top of the page.
5. Open the sidebar in the right by clicking the Stackedit logo
6. "Add a Github Workspace"
 **Note**: You do *not* need to grant Stackedit access to private repositories.
7. There will be three fields in a dialogue box. Enter these values:
	* **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/ymath-io/ymath.io`
	* **Folder Path**: `/content/courses`
	* **Branch**: your first name, in lowercase. (The name of that branch created in step 3)
8. You may or may not need to reload to see all the files - you should see a `calculus` and `exponents` folder.
