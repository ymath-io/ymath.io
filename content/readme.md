Welcome to the content writing guide for YMath! 

## Setting up a development environment

If this is your first time writing content for YMath, then we need to get your environment set up.
If this isn't your first time, then you'll want to skip this step.

1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ymath-io/content.git ymath-content
```
2. Move into the directory
```shell
cd ymath-content
```
3. Write your content in the `courses` directory.
4. When you are ready to publish your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'content: completed chapter 2 of conics'
# always prefix your commits with one of these:
  # 'content' : you added new material to a course
  # 'style' : you changed the formatting somewhere
  # 'fix' : you fixed a LaTeX error
  # 'order' : you rearranged course content
git push
```
