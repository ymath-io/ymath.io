  title: A New Way to Learn Math
  body: YMath is an organization determined to show learners how to think for themselves. We believe that math is a form of human logic, and our explanations of the way the world works is built upon that foundation.
    Because of this, we feel that learning math only requires asking oneself the right questions. All of our course content aims to ask students the right questions, and fuel their thought process.

      about: Hi, I'm Saumya, a junior at Gunn High School in Palo Alto, CA. I started YMath as a way of sharing some trigonometry lessons I had written in a notebook. My friends like to joke that I've taken the hippocratic oath for explaining math. In my free time, I enjoy programming various web apps and preparing for the AMC series competitions.
